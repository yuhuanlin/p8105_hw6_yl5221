### Data Cleaning

``` r
homicide_df =
  read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, ", ", state),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
    status = if_else(disposition == "Closed without arrest" | disposition == "Open/No arrest", "unsolved", "solved")
  ) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Dallas, TX" | city_state != "Phoenix, AZ" | city_state != "Kansas, MO" | city_state != "Tusla, AL") %>% 
  filter(victim_race == "White" | victim_race == "Black")
```
